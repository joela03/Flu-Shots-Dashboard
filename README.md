# Flu Shots Dashboard

This repository contains the files and resources used to create the Flu Shots Dashboard. The dashboard is designed to visualize and analyze data related to flu vaccinations, providing insights into vaccination rates, trends over time, and demographic patterns.

## Dashboard Overview

The Flu Shots Dashboard is built using Tableau and showcases data in a user-friendly, interactive format. Users can explore vaccination trends by various categories such as age group, location, and time period.

### Key Features:
- **Interactive Visualization**: The dashboard allows users to interact with the data and filter based on different parameters.
- **Vaccination Trends**: View trends in flu vaccinations over time.
- **Demographic Breakdown**: Explore vaccination rates by age, gender, and region.
- **Data Insights**: Gain insights into flu shot uptake and related factors.

## Query Explanation: Filtering Active Patients and Excluding Patients Under 6 Months

This query selects data for **active patients** who:
1. Have visited the hospital at least once in the year 2022.
2. Have received a flu vaccine (with the code `5302`).
3. Excludes patients who are under 6 months of age by the end of 2022 (since they are required to receive the vaccine by mandate).
